Hello! Trying to upload my project, the node_modules where too big to upload (+700MB) and even in a zip file they exceeded (250 MB) the limit (25 MB). I considered compressing each folder within node_modules, but they are more than 750. Respecting your time, I did not upload them. The code I wrote is within the 'prueba1' zip file and it is in the files:
  app/components/Card.js
  app/screens/ComunidadScreen.js
  app/screens/PorQueScreen.js
  app/screens/QuePuedoHacerHoyScreen.js
  app/screens/ReportarFugaScreen.js
  app/screens/WelcomeScreen.js
  App.js
  firebaseConfig.js
The rest are dependencies and packages. 
The code will not run until those dependencies and packages are installed. However, the packages-lock.json and packages.json contain all the name and version of the dependencies used in case you decide to install them. The 'Presentation video' of Aquapp contains a demonstration of the App running. In the case in which you cannot run it, I am totally willing to either make a zoom meeting or any other way you propose to see how the app works.
